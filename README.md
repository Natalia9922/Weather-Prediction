# Weather Prediction Regression Project

This is a project started as part of the Data Science course and continued by me and was created to consolidate knowledge. the project is not finished yet and will be developed.

# About project

This project goals to predict the weather variables using regression algorithms. The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle, specifically from the "Szeged Weather" dataset by budincsevity. The dataset contains historical weather information for the city of Szeged, Hungary.

The project utilizes machine learning algorithms to build a regression model that can accurately predict weather variables such as temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind speed, and more. The dataset consists of various features like temperature, humidity, wind speed, wind bearing, visibility, summary, and precipitation. These features will be used to train and test the regression models.

The dataset provided on Kaggle contains the following columns in the hourly response:

* Formatted Date: Date and time of the recorded weather data.
* Summary: Summary of the weather conditions.
* Precipitation Type: Type of precipitation (rain, snow).
* Temperature: Temperature in Celsius.
* Apparent Temperature: The felt temperature.
* Humidity: Humidity level.
* Wind Speed: Wind speed in km/h.
* Wind Bearing: Wind bearing in degrees.
* Visibility: Visibility in km.
* Loud Cover: The presence of Loud (0 for no loud)
* Pressure: Air pressure in millibars.
* Daily Summary: Summary of the day's weather conditions.
